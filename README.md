 * [x] Required: The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
 * [x] Required: You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
 * [x] Required: Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
 * [x] Required: TODO: Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
 * [x] Required: TODO: Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.For now deals filter works should get the remaining filters working

Notes

 I am having trouble when I first load the app . The first 4 rows seems to null then after scroll I can see the results after which it gets back to normal
